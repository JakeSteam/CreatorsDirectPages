1. <strong>Payment failure</strong>: If the PayPal recurring payment could not be taken, your apps will be kept in the stores for a minimum 7 day "grace period", after which they will be removed. If you resolve your funding issue before the grace period ends, please contact <a href="mailto:contact@creators.direct">support</a> to request a billing reattempt.<br>
2. <strong>Terms of service breach</strong>: We will generally only cancel service under extreme circumstances (for example hate speech, illegal activity, harassment of others), and will try to contact you to resolve the issues beforehand.

<div class="panel-body">In general, avoid using illegal / copyrighted / offensive material, and avoid misleading others. Obviously many streamers have offensive language, and that's absolutely fine, it's generally more extreme racist / sexual "jokes" that will cause an issue. Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/" target="_blank">Review Guidelines</a> and Google's <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/" target="_blank">Developer Policy Center</a> have comprehensive lists of all restricted content.<br><br>
If Google / Apple's rules are broken, they are likely to remove your app from their store. If in any doubt, please ask <a href="mailto:contact@creators.direct">support</a> for assistance!</div>

These earnings can be hooked up to either email, StreamTip, or StreamLabs integrations to receive alerts in real time. However, mobile earnings have advantages and disadvantage to be considered when compared to traditional earnings. Please see the other Earnings FAQs for more info.</div>

<div id="earnings-what-fees-do-earnings-incur" class="panel-collapse collapse " role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingearnings-what-fees-do-earnings-incur">
<div class="panel-body">There are 2 fees when receiving earnings. The first is the payment handler (getting the earnings from the fan -> Creators.Direct), the second is our fee (getting the earnings from Creators.Direct -> you). These fees will be broken down below.<br><br>
Apple or Google (depending on platform) take 30% of every transaction. This is to cover all the identity management, chargeback insurance, currency conversion, bank fees, and other services provided in order to verify and receive the contribution. There is unfortunately no way to reduce / avoid this fee.<br><br>
In addition, Creators.Direct charges 7% of the total to cover the fees, paperwork, and configuration required to transfer between our accounts and your Paypal. Earnings also undergo additional security checks, above what the platforms themselves offer. PayPal charges approximately 3.6% + a fixed fee on every transaction, which is included in this fee. The 7% figure is exactly 10% of the post-payment processor amount, to make accounting easier.<br><br>
In summary, you will receive 63% of every paid amount, the vast majority of the fee being to payment processors. However, there are a lot of advantages which may offset this fee in your case, continue reading for more information!</div>

<div id="earnings-what-are-the-advantages-of-earnings" class="panel-collapse collapse " role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingearnings-what-are-the-advantages-of-earnings">
<div class="panel-body">Earnings themselves are an excellent way of receiving additional income whilst creating your content. They are heavily utilised by streamers, and allow fans to contribute more privileged messages than a normal chat. A common motivation to give money is the streamer reading out their name and message, or suggesting an action to take in a game.<br><br>
Mobile earnings are a relatively untapped source of potential revenue, meaning they will generally be in addition to existing earnings, not replace them. For example, many users have unused iTunes and Google Play credit which cannot be given to a content creator in any way besides a system like Creators.Direct.<br><br>
In addition, receiving earnings via your app will encourage users to use it more often, and stay more engaged. They will also be able to receive contributor-only notifications from yourself, which may convert fans into contributors.<br><br>
Additionally, having earnings in the same app as all of your content provides a more connected experience for your fans. For example, you may make an announcement that the names of all contributors in the next 7 days will be used in an upcoming video. With Creators.Direct, they can seamlessly read the announcement then make a contribution.<br><br>
Finally, chargebacks aren't as common via mobile methods, as users are less willing to risk any consequent negative action on their Google or Apple accounts. As such, you can be more confident that a received payment is genuine.</div>

<div class="panel-body">The primary disadvantage of mobile payments is the fees associated with them, as described above. For more information on these please see the relevant FAQ.<br><br>
In addition, users are a lot more likely to attempt "fake" payments. Due to this, Creators.Direct enforces additional security on top of the usual Apple / Google safety checks, by communicating with a central server before accepting a message. You will not receive an alert (and it will not be included in any summaries) until it has passed additional verification.<br><br>
Finally, you will not receive your earnings immediately (but it should still be faster than existing Paypal-centred solutions). Please see the following FAQ for more information on payment schedules.</div>

Notifications can be sent to all Android users, all iOS users, or both. Additionally, they can be sent to all users, donators, or non-donators.
